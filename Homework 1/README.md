# Traveling Salesmen solution using Genetic Algorithm

1. Problem Overview:
- Goal is to find the shortest path/least costing path that we can take to start from point A, visit all other points, and come back to point A. 

2. Possible solutions:
- Generally there are multiple algorithms that we can use to solve this like, BFS, DFS, or A*. However, Traveling Salesmen Problem is an NP-Complete problem therefore we used the Genetic Algortihm to solve the problem.
